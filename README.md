Interval identification game: Use musical interval notation (m2 = minor second, M2 = major second, D5 = diminished fifth, etc...) to guess the interval between the two notes you hear (note: please use D5 instead of A4 for tri-tone or else you will get an incorrect answer).

Scale melodic dictation game: Choose a scale from which four random notes will be selected and guess what scale tone each of the four notes you hear is, relative to the selected scale, as well as the interval from each note you hear to the next. Please use scale tone notation to guess the scale tone of each note (2 = major/natural second, 3 = major third, b3 = minor third, etc...) and regular interval notation for the interval questions. This game is more challenging, so take your time getting used to it. 

Please note that all interval values will be represented as if they were within one octave even if the actual interval is greater than an octave.
